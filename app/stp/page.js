                  Standard temperature and pressure (STP) or Standard conditions
                  for temperature and pressure are various standard sets of
                  conditions for experimental measurements used to allow
                  comparisons to be made between different sets of data. The
                  most used standards are those of the International Union of
                  Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the National Institute
                  of Standards and Technology (NIST), although these are not
                  universally accepted. Other organizations have established a
                  variety of other definitions. In industry and commerce, the
                  standard conditions for temperature and pressure are often
                  necessary for expressing the volumes of gases and liquids and
                  related quantities such as the rate of volumetric flow (the
                  volumes of gases vary significantly with temperature and
                  pressure): standard cubic meters per second (Sm3/s), and
                  normal cubic meters per second (Nm3/s).

                STP conditions are important to calculate and express fluid flow
                rates and the volumes of liquids and gases when standard state
                conditions are applied. These properties are also highly
                dependent on temperature and pressure conditions and changes.
                Adopting and stating standard conditions enable similar
                experiments to occur in similar laboratory conditions and to
                generate similar and comparable results. It also makes it easier
                to compare different measurements for gases, such as the moles
                (mol) of gas in a given volume. Both temperature and air
                pressure vary from one place to another. To test, compare and
                document chemical and physical processes where temperature and
                pressure play a role, including data centers or anywhere
                computers are used, a standard reference of both is required.
